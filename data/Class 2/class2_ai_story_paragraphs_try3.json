Old Man Tiber, predictably, was already at the crossroads, polishing his cart wheels and offering pronouncements on the weather\u2014which, he insisted, was a direct reflection of the Baron\u2019s mood. Elara avoided his gaze; she\u2019d learned long ago that engaging him only prolonged the encounter and invited unwanted commentary on her unmarried state. Twenty-two summers, and still unwed. A quiet scandal in Oakhaven. She wasn\u2019t *against* marriage, not precisely. It was the *how* of it that chafed. The parade of eligible\u2014and often, painfully dull\u2014young men paraded before her by her mother, each assessed for land holdings, lineage, and the strength of their backs for tilling. As if she were a prize heifer, not a woman with thoughts and inclinations of her own.",

A stolen hour amongst the willows by the river. Rhys, the Baron\u2019s nephew, come down from the city to \u201cfind himself\u201d amongst the peasantry, as her mother sniffed. Rhys, who didn\u2019t seem to notice\u2014or care\u2014that her hands were roughened from helping with the garden, that her dress was simple linen, that her dowry was modest. He was there, leaning against the largest willow, sunlight dappling through the leaves onto his dark hair. He looked up as she approached, a slow smile spreading across his face. It wasn\u2019t a condescending smile, the kind she\u2019d grown accustomed to. It was\u2026warm. Genuine. \u201cElara,\u201d he said, his voice a low rumble. \u201cI thought you might not come. Tiber was being particularly ominous about the clouds.\u201d \u201cTiber is always ominous,\u201d she replied, returning the smile. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t miss it.

Elara walked down the aisle, a puppet in a lavish costume, her face a mask of composure. She barely registered the faces of the guests, the music, the vows.

She\u2019d seen the way Beatrice\u2019s husband, Arthur, looked at her during the church social last month\u2014a possessive glint in his eye that hadn\u2019t been there before their silver wedding anniversary. And Beatrice, always so vibrant, so *present*, had begun to fade, her laughter losing its chime, her dresses becoming drabber. \u201cAnother biscuit, dear?\u201d Mrs. Gable, a woman whose life revolved around the meticulous arrangement of doilies and the dissemination of information, offered the plate. Elara managed a smile, taking a small one. Mrs. Gable\u2019s biscuits were legendary, but Elara found she had little appetite. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Gable. They\u2019re lovely.\u201d",

Never understood Beatrice\u2019s spirit, not at all.\u201d Elara nodded, stirring her tea. Havenwood thrived on these little currents of speculation, these quiet assessments of character. It was a small town, after all; everyone knew everyone else\u2019s business, or at least, *thought* they did. And a woman vanishing\u2014even a woman as outwardly contented as Beatrice\u2014was a feast for the gossip mill. Her own situation wasn\u2019t exactly fodder for polite conversation, but it wasn\u2019t ignored either. Elara\u2019s father, the late Reverend Thorne, had left her the small cottage and a modest income, enough to live on, but not enough to attract a \u201csuitable\u201d husband. At thirty-two, she was considered\u2026well, *past it*. A spinster. A woman who\u2019d chosen books and quiet contemplation over hearth and home.",

The gossip continued, growing more lurid with each retelling. Some said Beatrice had run off with a traveling salesman; others whispered of a secret lover. A few, the bolder ones, hinted at something far more sinister. Elara found herself increasingly drawn to the Ainsworth property, ostensibly to leave flowers at the gate, but really to observe, to search for clues.

Elsie listened, offering occasional words of sympathy, but her mind was racing. She thought of Daniel, of his own restlessness, of the unspoken pressure she and Thomas had placed on him to carry on the family legacy. Was she, in her own way, becoming like Clara Peterson? A keeper of expectations, a dispenser of judgment? The thought was unsettling. Later that afternoon, Thomas came in from the fields, his face sunburned and his boots caked with mud. He found Elsie sitting at the kitchen table, staring at a faded photograph of Daniel as a boy. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, his voice gruff but gentle. Elsie hesitated, then handed him the photograph. \u201cJust thinking about Daniel,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd about Clara Peterson. And about\u2026everything.\u201d",

The Ashworths, with their garish carriages and Mrs. Ashworth\u2019s shockingly low-cut gowns, were a blatant disruption. \u201cDo pay attention, Amelia,\u201d her mother said, her voice a silken reprimand. \u201cMr. Ashworth is detailing his recent acquisition of the Blackwood estate.\u201d Amelia forced a smile, turning her attention to the man in question. He was broad, booming, and smelled faintly of cigars and something else\u2014something aggressively masculine that made her nostrils twitch. He was speaking, of course, about Blackwood, the estate that had been in the Hawthorne family for generations before falling into disrepair and, ultimately, foreclosure. A tragedy, really. The Hawthornes had been *good* people, quiet and charitable, though perhaps a little\u2026 faded.",

Amelia practiced her music, but the melodies felt hollow, devoid of their usual solace.

Ma barely spoke to me, and when she did, it was only to issue curt instructions or disapproving glances. I retreated into myself, spending hours in the barn, sketching and dreaming. Old Man Hemlock, surprisingly, didn\u2019t seem to mind my presence. He\u2019d let me watch him work on the tractor, occasionally even explaining the intricacies of the engine. He didn\u2019t ask about my embroidery, or my prospects for marriage. He just let me be. One afternoon, while I was sketching the distributor, he said, \u201cYou got a good eye, girl.

We moved to a small cottage near the railway line, a constant reminder of the forces that were reshaping our world. Domestic life, however, proved\u2026complicated. Thornton was often away, overseeing construction projects in other towns. When he was home, he was preoccupied with his work, with calculations and blueprints and the endless demands of his employers.

He didn\u2019t ask about Mr. Finch, or her family, or her future. He asked about her art, her passions, her dreams. He listened with a genuine curiosity that she\u2019d never experienced before. As the sun began to set, he took her hand. \u201cCome with me,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave Oakhaven. Come and paint with me. Live a life of your own choosing.\u201d",

She accepted his proposal, married him, and bore him sons. She continued to stitch samplers and embroider cushions, her fingers moving mechanically, her mind lost in a world of what-ifs. She never painted again. But sometimes, late at night, when the house was quiet and her husband was asleep, she would climb to the attic and take out her old sketches, tracing the lines with her fingertips, remembering the man who had seen her, truly seen her, and the life she had almost dared to live. The chill in her bones never quite went away. It was the chill of a dream deferred, a potential unfulfilled, a self lost in the shadows of suitability.",

It was forged in the heat of the struggle, in the shared risk of fighting for a better world. It was practical, grounded, and deeply meaningful. We married in a small ceremony, attended by a handful of friends and fellow activists. No fancy dresses, no elaborate feast. Just a simple exchange of vows and a shared commitment to building a life based on justice and equality. The strike intensified. The owners brought in scabs, men desperate enough to work for any wage. Violence erupted. The streets of New Birmingham became a battleground. I found myself on the picket lines, facing down angry workers and brutal police. Sarah was arrested, accused of inciting unrest. I spent days frantically trying to secure her release, pleading with lawyers and politicians, raising money for her defense. It was a terrifying time, but it also solidified our bond. We were in this together, fighting for something bigger than ourselves.",

He worked the night shift at the mill, same as my father, same as half the men in town. It wasn\u2019t a life that fostered grand dreams.

Scared for Maeve, yes, but also scared for myself. Because if Daniel could walk away from a good woman, from a solid life, what did that say about the promises whispered in the dark?",

He studied the canvas for a long moment. \u201cIt\u2019s raw. It\u2019s honest. It\u2019s *you*. Don\u2019t try to smooth it out, Elsie. Don\u2019t try to make it palatable. Let it be messy. Let it be uncomfortable. That\u2019s where the truth lies.\u201d His words were a lifeline. I realized I\u2019d been trying to paint what Havenwood wanted to see\u2014pretty landscapes, charming portraits\u2014instead of what I needed to express. I started to paint my feelings, my anxieties, my longing for something more. I painted the rain-lashed streets of Havenwood, the chipped Formica of the diner booth, the weight of expectations.",

I imagined the whispers, the sideways glances, the constant scrutiny. I also imagined Thomas having a new coat, Ma sleeping without the weight of worry on her chest, a small measure of security in a world that felt increasingly precarious. That evening, Ma was mending Thomas\u2019s trousers, her needle flashing in the dim light. She looked up as I entered, her face etched with fatigue.",

First the older guys, the ones with pensions, then the newer hires, then\u2026well, then anyone they could manage. Leo had been lucky, so far. Foreman material, they said.

He courted me properly, taking me to the occasional picture show, bringing me small gifts\u2014a ribbon for my hair, a book of poetry.

There was a bittersweetness to it all, a sense of leaving something behind. Leaving Lowell was harder than I imagined. The mill loomed over the train station as we departed, a monstrous silhouette against the gray sky. My father stood on the platform, his face stoic, his hand raised in a silent farewell. I wanted to run back to him, to stay, to cling to the familiar misery. But Thomas held my hand, his grip firm and reassuring. Boston was\u2026overwhelming. The streets were crowded, the buildings tall, the pace frantic. Thomas had secured a position with a construction firm, and we rented a small apartment in a working-class neighborhood.

The college was everything Oakhaven wasn\u2019t\u2014bustling, vibrant, full of women who spoke their minds and debated ideas with a fervor I\u2019d never witnessed. Miss Ainsworth, my history tutor, was a radical, a woman who believed in education as a tool for social reform. She encouraged us to question everything, to challenge the established order. It was exhilarating, and terrifying. I wrote to Mother every week, carefully curating my letters to downplay the excitement and emphasize my diligence. I couldn\u2019t bear to worry her further. But the truth was, I was changing. I was learning about the world beyond Oakhaven, about the injustices and inequalities that existed everywhere. I was beginning to understand that \u201crespect\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. That a comfortable life built on the backs of others wasn\u2019t something to be proud of. One evening, I overheard a conversation in the dining hall. Two girls, Clara and Beatrice, were discussing the Harding mill. \u201cTerrible what happened to the workers, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clara said, stirring her tea. \u201cMy father says Harding is a ruthless man.

They knew wood, they understood the process. It wasn\u2019t about literacy; it was about knowledge.\u201d Clara and Beatrice stared at me, surprised. I wasn\u2019t known for speaking out. \u201cYou seem rather passionate about this,\u201d Beatrice said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cMy father owned the mill,\u201d I admitted, my cheeks flushing. \u201cBefore he sold it.\u201d The silence that followed was heavy.

It doesn\u2019t excuse the way those men were treated.\u201d That conversation was a turning point. I started attending meetings of the college\u2019s debating society, speaking out on issues of social justice.

But beneath the surface, I knew, life was still stirring, waiting for the spring.

But it wasn\u2019t\u2026 this.\u201d I gestured around the diner, encompassing Havenwood with a single, frustrated wave of my hand. \u201cThis feeling of being\u2026 stuck. Like the river\u2019s frozen over and everyone\u2019s just waiting for it to thaw, but it never does.\u201d \u201cThis is our home, Elsie. Your father built a life here. A good life.\u201d \u201cA life *he* wanted,\u201d I mumbled, instantly regretting it. The silence stretched, thick and uncomfortable. Tiber cleared his throat loudly, pointedly polishing a glass. Mama\u2019s eyes, usually so full of gentle concern, were now clouded with disappointment. \u201cWhat would you even *do* in the city?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cYou have a job here. A future.\u201d",

It wasn\u2019t about my dreams; it was about practicality. About survival. About maintaining the status quo. But what kind of survival was it, if it meant suffocating the very thing that made me *me*? \u201cThere\u2019s a scholarship, Mama. I applied. I\u2026 I got accepted.\u201d The words tumbled out, a desperate plea for understanding. Her hand went to her chest, as if physically wounded. \u201cAccepted? To what?
