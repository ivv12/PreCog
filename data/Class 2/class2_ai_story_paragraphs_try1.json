He spent his days tending to his garden, a meticulously ordered patch of vegetables and flowers. He rarely spoke to anyone, but Elias often saw him watching, his eyes narrowed, assessing.

He thought about the river, about its relentless flow, about its ability to carry both refuse and life. He realized that Oakhaven wasn\u2019t a place of opportunity, not in the way his cousin had described. It was a place of struggle, of hardship, of constant change. But it was also a place of hidden beauty, of quiet kindness, of unexpected connections. The next morning, Elias woke to find a note slipped under his door.",

How could she explain the shame? One afternoon, she found herself walking towards the abandoned textile mill. The building loomed over the town, a skeletal reminder of its former glory. The windows were broken, the walls covered in graffiti. It was a desolate place, but Elara felt drawn to it. She climbed through a hole",

She was twenty-two, an age when girls in neighboring villages were choosing husbands, setting up homes. Here, in Hollow Creek, twenty-two meant you were still considered\u2026waiting. Waiting for a suitable offer, waiting for a softening of your mother\u2019s expectations, waiting for something, anything, to shift. \u201cI\u2019ll do the carrots later,\u201d she said, knowing the \u2018later\u2019 would stretch into the evening, and then into another day.
