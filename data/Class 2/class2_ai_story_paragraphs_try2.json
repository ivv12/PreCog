Clara Hemlock, despite the disapproval of some, was determined to have a grand affair. The town hall was decorated with flowers, a caterer was brought in from the city, and invitations were sent to everyone within a fifty-mile radius. Elara found herself drawn into the preparations, not by any particular desire to celebrate the marriage, but by a sense of obligation. She was asked to help with the floral arrangements, and she reluctantly agreed. It gave her something to do, a distraction from the quiet in her own home. While arranging the flowers, she overheard snippets of conversation. Mrs. Gable,",

Her lack of experience was a constant obstacle. Employers preferred candidates with established skills, with references from reputable families. Elara had neither. She began to question her decision. Had she been foolish to leave Oakhaven? Had she overestimated her own abilities? Was she destined to fail?

Mr. Theron, determined to quell any opposition, increased his security presence on the estate. He dismissed several of the Blackwood workers prematurely, creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. Caspian, refusing to be silenced, organized a small gathering in the village square, inviting the Blackwood families and anyone else who opposed the acquisition. He spoke passionately about the importance of community, the need for social justice, and the dangers of unchecked power. The gathering attracted the attention of Mr. Theron, who arrived with a contingent of estate guards. He ordered the crowd to disperse, threatening to arrest anyone who refused to comply.",

Old Man Tiber, mostly, perched on his porch swing, or young Thomas, delivering milk, or, like Elara, simply observing from a window. The village of Oakhaven wasn\u2019t large enough to truly hide anything. Not secrets, not disappointments, not even a lukewarm cup of tea. It was a network, woven tight with shared histories and the constant, low hum of observation. Elara\u2019s mother used to call it a kindness, knowing your neighbors were looking out for you.

She began to spend more time in the garden, not just tending to the vegetables, but experimenting with flowers, creating small, hidden pockets of beauty. She started to read books that Thomas dismissed as frivolous, novels about women who defied convention, who pursued their own passions. She even enrolled in a correspondence course in drawing, using her spare moments to sketch and practice. These small acts of defiance didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Thomas grew increasingly distant, his disapproval palpable. He criticized her gardening, her reading, her drawing. He",
