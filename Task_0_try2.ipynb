    "**Limitation of Try 2:**\n",
    "While story-level generation creates more natural flow than Try 1's isolated paragraphs, the style guidance is still abstract (e.g., \"use complex sentences,\" \"employ irony\"). The model interprets these guidelines based on its training, which may not capture the **specific nuances** of Austen or Gaskell's actual prose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Try 3 Approach:**\n",
    "Instead of abstract style guides, Try 3 will use **few-shot prompting with actual examples**:\n",
    "1. **Extract 3-5 representative paragraphs** from each author's novels (Class 1)\n",
    "2. **Show these as examples** in the prompt before generation\n",
    "3. **Generate stories** that mimic the demonstrated style more precisely\n",
    "4. **Extract paragraphs** as in Try 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Might Work Better:**\n",
    "- Model sees **concrete examples** of Austen/Gaskell's actual writing\n",
    "- Can capture **specific patterns**: sentence structure, word choice, punctuation habits\n",
    "- Mimics the \"in-context learning\" that makes LLMs good at style transfer\n",
    "- Should produce Class 3 text that's **harder to distinguish** from Class 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk/Trade-off:**\n",
    "- **Direct phrase copying**: Model might paraphrase or repeat exact sentences from examples\n",
    "- **Template rigidity**: Outputs might follow the same structural pattern as examples\n",
    "- **Reduced diversity**: Strong anchoring might limit stylistic exploration beyond what examples demonstrate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation:**\n",
    "- Use examples from **different novels/chapters** to show style variety\n",
    "- Post-process similarity checks to detect direct copying\n",
    "- Use high temperature (1.0+) to encourage variation while maintaining style\n",
    "- Rotate different example sets across generations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why topic leakage is NOT a concern:**\n",
    "- All classes already share the same 9 topics by design\n",
    "- Examples show HOW to write about those topics in the target style\n",
    "- The goal is learning style patterns, not introducing new content areas\n",
    "\n",
    "If Try 3 works, Class 3 should approach human-level stylistic authenticity. If it overfits, we'll see verbatim copying or mechanical template-following rather than genuine style transfer."
